# Titanic

The Titanic competition is the 'Hello World' of the competitions available on Kaggle. It is composed of two sets: train.csv and test.csv.

The train set contains the features and the label of XXX persons... and the test contains only the features (replace with values)

## Overview of the data

The page/table Data dictionary(make link§§§§§§) provides information about the features and theirs (ortho??) values. Here is the table that sums up the things... (place table)

1st = Upper

Parent = mother, father

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them

## Evaluation of the model

The precision classifying algorithm y??? is evaluated by Kaggle with the test data.
